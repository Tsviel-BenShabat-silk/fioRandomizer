# FIO Random Walk Simulator

This project provides a way to run FIO (Flexible I/O Tester) using parameters generated through a random walk simulation. The tool adjusts both the IOPS values and block sizes over time, allowing users to simulate various IO patterns.

## Features

- Simulate IO patterns through a random walk over fio command parameters.
- Can adjust block size distributions and IOPS rate.
- Accepts user inputs for device and job count.
- Supports different OS environments by detecting the OS type and generating appropriate device paths.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `numpy` installed.
- FIO should be installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd [repository_directory]
```

2. Run the main script using the following command:
```bash
python main_script_name.py -d DEVICE_NAME -j NUMBER_OF_JOBS
```
Replace `main_script_name.py` with the actual name of your script.

### Parameters

- `--device`: Specifies the device to be tested. The input format should be the device name for Linux (e.g., "nvme0n1p5") or the drive letter for Windows (e.g., "C:").
  
- `--jobs`: (Optional) Number of jobs to run in parallel. Default is `1`.

- `--output-dir`: (Optional) Directory where the output logs and results will be saved.

- `--readonly`: (Optional) Determines if the `fio` test will be run in read-only mode. Accepts `True` or `False` values. Default is `True`.

- `--random-seed`: (Optional) Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. Default is `1`.

### Examples:

For a Linux device with 4 jobs in read-only mode:
```bash
python main_script_name.py -d nvme0n1p5 -j 4 --readonly
```

For a Windows device (drive C) with 1 job:
```bash
python main_script_name.py -d C
```

## Understanding the Output

The output will vary based on the provided inputs and the nature of the random walk. Typical outputs include generated FIO commands which are influenced by the simulation.

## Limitations

- Current simulation parameters like block sizes and IOPS rate bounds are fixed.
